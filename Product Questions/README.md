This is a magento product question and answer extension. This extension is created from aheadworks old product question extension, with some
modifictions. 

It has very useful feature for products. If a customer has any query or question regarding the product he can ask the question from the product page.
And the admin will reply to those questions.

It also allows to rate helpfulness for the answer's with yes and no options.
Also if customer thinks the answer is not appropriate he/she can report for that answer with report link.

The admin can also send the email to the customer who asked the question while answering the question from the backend.

The question form will appear under the tabs on the product page. And below that the questions and answers will be shown. 

In the admin it can be found under Catalog -> Product Questions with questions and settings. Also we can got to the settings through System ->
Configuration -> MANOJSINGH Q.A EXTENSION -> Product Questions.

This extension is tested on magento 1.6 to 1.9 version. But if you still have any problem please contact me.
