This repository contains some of my magento extensions.

1. Extra fee extension: This extension allows you to charge extra fee in the cart totals.
2. Contact form extended: This extension allows you to add contact form on any cms page and reach the same page after form submit. 
3. Product price suggestion: This extension allows customers to suggest price for the product and which will be sent to the admin. It will allow the admin to look at the suggested prices and if the admin decide's to change the product's price on customer's request the admin can also send email to those customer's with the new price.
4. Product Questions: This is a magento product question and answer extension. It allows customers to ask questions for the product.
