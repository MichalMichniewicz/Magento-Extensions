Extra fee extension allows you to charge extra fee to your cart totals. And it works with paypal payment method also.

In admin goto System->Configuration->Additional fee extension->Manage fee and enter the fee amount.

This extension is tested on magento 1.6 to 1.9 version. But if you still have any problem please contact me.
